In each of the exchanges described in this guide, the client SHALL provide proof of authorization. Implementers SHOULD implement OAuth 2.0 access management in accordance with the [SMART Backend Services: Authorization Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/authorization/index.html), as the exchanges in this guide do not require user access authorization and may run autonomously.

In addition, implementers are expected to...
- follow core [FHIR security principles](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/security.html).
 
- protect patient privacy as described in [FHIR Security and Privacy Considerations](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/secpriv-module.html).

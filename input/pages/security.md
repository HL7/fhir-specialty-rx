FHIR does not mandate a single technical approach to security and privacy; rather, the specification provides a set of building blocks that can be applied to create secure, private systems. 

- Implementers are expected to follow core [FHIR security principles](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/security.html).

- In addition, the [FHIR Security and Privacy Module](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/secpriv-module.html#6.0] [http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/secpriv-module.html) describes how to protect patient privacy.

Because the exchanges in this guide do not require user access authorization and may run autonomously, implementers may consider use of [SMART Backend Services Authorization](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU1/authorization/index.html).

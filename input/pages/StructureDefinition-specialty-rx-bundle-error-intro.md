This profile defines the content of the Specialty Rx Error message bundle, which is transmitted by a Data Source when it encounters an error that prevents it from responding to a Specialty Rx Query message. See [Error Handling](error-handling.html) additional guidance for this scenario and also situations where the Data Source cannot process an individual search within a Query message.

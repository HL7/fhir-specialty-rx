### US Core Profiles Used With This Guide

The [Search Conventions](searches.html) section outlines required and recommended searches performed in this guide's query workflows. These searches conform to US Core search parameter requirements and SHALL return resources that conform to US Core resource profiles.

Further, when other resources not profiled in this implementation guide are exchanged as part of a Specialty Rx workflow (for example, other resource types returned in response to a Specialty Rx Query message), they SHOULD conform to US Core profiles where applicable profiles exist.

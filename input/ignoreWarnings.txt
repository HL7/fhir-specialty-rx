# Messaging components that are only instantiated within full messages (MessageHeaders, Parameters, Search Bundles) don't have their own examples, but instead are illustrated in full message examples referenced on the profile pages: specialty-rx-bundle-search-result.xml (in examples specialty-rx-query-response-1, -2, -3-w-op-outcome and -unsolicited-1), specialty-rx-messageheader-error.xml (in example specialty-rx-error-1), specialty-rx-messageheader-query.xml (in example specialty-rx-query-1), specialty-rx-messageheader-query-response.xml (in examples specialty-rx-query-response-1 -2 and -3-w-op-outcome), specialty-rx-messageheader-query-response-unsolicited.xml (in example query-response-unsolicited-1), specialty-rx-parameters-query.xml (in example specialty-rx-query-1), specialty-rx-parameters-query-response.xml (in examples specialty-rx-query-response-1, -2 and -3-w-op-outcome), specialty-rx-parameters-query-response-unsolicited.xml (in example query-response-unsolicited-1)
The Implementation Guide contains no explicitly linked examples for this profile

# A variance to the US Core Coverage profile was granted by Cross Group Projects WG. See FHIR-40814
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Coverage derive from the core US profile

# The fixed value constraint referenced by the warning is in the base R4 Consent and not modified by this IG (StructureDefinition element #35 - policyRule)
For the complex type CodeableConcept, consider using a pattern rather than a fixed value to avoid over-constraining the instance

# Using standard extension capabilitystatement-expectation for CapabilityStatement in additional contexts to express search parameter capabilities: see FHIR-12419
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/capabilitystatement-search-parameter-combination|4.0.1

# This Organization example illustrates a US Core organization resource. Population of NPI matches that in US Core
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-organization|3.1.1

# This example intentionally includes an error in the search string, in order to illustrate an OperationOutcome response
No types could be determined from the search string, so the types can''t be checked

# The base R4 Consent StructureDefinition contains an error in the element.example value of Consent.identifier (Consent.identifier element, example.valueIdentifier.system = "urn:ietf:rfc:3986"). Confirmed with CBCP WG that it can be ignored
if identifier.system is 'rn:ietf:rfc:3986', then the identifier.value must be a full URI (e.g. start with a scheme)
